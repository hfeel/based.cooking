The curry itself is robust and sweet, with the grated apple shining through many of the flavors.

- 2 cm piece of ginger, grated
- 500 g (1.1 lb) cubed stewing beef
- 4 tbsp plain flour
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp ground cardamom
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp hot chili powder
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp ground clove
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 200 ml (0.84 cups) red wine
- 600 ml (2.53 cups) beef stock
- 1 bay leaf
- 10 g (~1 tbsp) chocolate

## Directions

1. Heat a tbsp of vegetable oil in a medium pan. Start some rice in your rice cooker to go with this. 
2. Put onions in pan and cook over low heat until softened (approximately 10 minutes)
3. Increase heat to medium and cook until onion begins turning golden color, stirring occasionally. The longer you fry them, the more flavor they'll add to the curry, but you don't want to caramelize them
4. Add minced garlic, grated carrot, ginger, and apple. Stir to combine.
5. Cook for 2 minutes, then remove from heat and set aside.
6. Since the onion cooks for a while, you can cook the beef  while the onion softens, but be careful to not let either burn.
7. Take the trimmed beef cubes and throw them into a clean pan. Cook over medium heat until the sides are browned. Remove from heat and set aside. 
8. Add flour to the pan over medium heat. Once you start smelling the flour cooking a little, you're getting closer.
Once flour is sufficiently heated and/or starting to turn golden, add all other spices (ground coriander, cumin, turmeric, cardamom, 
cinnamon, chili powder, nutmeg, ground clove, black pepper). 
9. Cook on medium heat for 2 minutes or until fragrant. Then cut heat. 
10. Heat a deep, wide pan over medium heat. 
11. Add spice mix, onion mix, and beef. 
12. Add beef stock, red wine, and bay leaf. Stir until combined. 
13. Bring to a light boil. 
14. Lower heat but keep a light boil. Cover with lid and simmer (90 minutes to 2 hours). If the curry lowers
too much, you can add a little bit of water. 
15. Remove lid and add instant coffee, chocolate, plain yogurt, honey, and Worcestershire sauce.  
16. Stir and let simmer for 15 minutes. 
17. It's done, remove the bay leaf and plate it up with some rice. You can put the curry on the 
side of the rice or on the rice. It's up to you. You can also change the ingredients if you like (add some gochugaru powder to make it hotter, etc.)
